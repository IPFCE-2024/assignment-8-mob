a) How many arithmetic operations are required to compute fact(5)?

    For every loop iteration, the following will happen:
    i+1
    i*f
    In total, this is two arithmetic operations per loop.
    The loop wil run n times. n is 5. 5*2=10
    10 arithmetic opeartions are required to compute fact(5).

b) How many arithmetic operations are required to compute fact(n)
for any positive integer n?

    As written previously, two arithmetic operations per loop.
    The loop wil run n times.
    n*2 arithmetic opeartions are required to compute fact(n).
