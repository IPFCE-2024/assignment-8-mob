a) How many arithmetic operations (+, −, ∗, /) are required to compute fact(5)?

The loop runs from i = 1 to i <= 5, so there are 5 iterations.

In each iteration, one multiplication operation is performed: f = i * f.
So, for fact(5), there will be 5 multiplication operations.

b) 

For any positive integer n, the loop will run n times (from i = 1 to i = n), 
performing one multiplication per iteration.

So, for fact(n), there will be n multiplication operations.
Thus, n arithmetic operations (multiplication) are required to compute fact(n) 
for any positive integer n.
